We're thrilled to announce the public release of **MultiTenantKit** — a production-ready, open-source TypeScript toolkit designed to accelerate the development of multi-tenant B2B SaaS applications.

## The Problem We're Solving

Every B2B SaaS application needs the same foundational features:

- **User management** — Create, update, and manage user profiles
- **Organization/Team management** — Multi-tenant containers for companies
- **Membership management** — Role-based access control within organizations

Yet, developers spend weeks (or months) rebuilding this same infrastructure for every new project. The alternatives aren't great either:

- **SaaS platforms** lock your data in their infrastructure
- **Auth providers** only handle authentication, not multi-tenancy
- **Existing libraries** are often tightly coupled to specific frameworks

## Enter MultiTenantKit

MultiTenantKit takes a different approach. It's a **library that runs in your codebase**, giving you:

- 🎯 **18 Production-Ready Use Cases** — User CRUD, organization management, membership workflows
- 🏗️ **Hexagonal Architecture** — Swap databases, frameworks, or auth providers without changing business logic
- 🔧 **Full Extensibility** — Add custom fields with type-safe Zod schemas
- 🪝 **Powerful Hooks** — Inject custom logic at any point in the use case lifecycle

## Quick Start

Get a complete API running in 3 lines of code:

```typescript
import { createSupabaseExpressApp } from '@multitenantkit/sdk';

const app = createSupabaseExpressApp();

app.listen(3000);
```

**That's it.** You now have 18 endpoints for managing users, organizations, and memberships.

> 📋 **Note:** Before running, you'll need to set up your database tables. Check out the [Installation Guide](/docs/getting-started/installation) for the complete setup instructions.

## Make It Yours

Need to store additional data? Add custom fields with type-safe Zod schemas:

```typescript
import { createSupabaseExpressApp } from '@multitenantkit/sdk';
import { z } from 'zod';

const app = createSupabaseExpressApp({
  users: {
    customFields: {
      customSchema: z.object({
        firstName: z.string(),
        lastName: z.string(),
        avatar: z.string().url().optional(),
      }),
    },
  },
  organizations: {
    customFields: {
      customSchema: z.object({
        industry: z.string().optional(),
        size: z.enum(['startup', 'small', 'medium', 'enterprise']).optional(),
      }),
    },
  },
});

app.listen(3000);
```

Want to send a welcome email when a user is created? Use hooks:

```typescript
const app = createSupabaseExpressApp({
  useCaseHooks: {
    CreateUser: {
      onSuccess: async ({ stepResults }) => {
        await sendWelcomeEmail(stepResults.output.email);
      },
    },
  },
});
```

## What's Next?

We're just getting started. On our roadmap:

- 🔄 **Webhooks & Events** — React to changes in real-time
- 📧 **Email Invitations** — Complete invitation flow
- 🔐 **More Auth Adapters** — Auth0, Firebase, custom JWT
- 📊 **Audit Logs** — Track all operations
- 💳 **Billing Integration** — Connect organizations with subscription plans
