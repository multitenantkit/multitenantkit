# Endpoints Overview

MultiTenantKit provides a complete REST API with 18 endpoints for managing users, organizations, and memberships. Each endpoint corresponds to a use case and follows REST conventions.

## Authentication

Most endpoints require authentication via JWT token:
- **Required**: User must be authenticated (JWT token in `Authorization` header)
- **Optional**: Endpoint works with or without authentication

When authentication is required, the `principalExternalId` (user's auth provider ID) is automatically extracted from the JWT token and passed to the use case.

## Response Format

All successful responses follow this format:

```json
{
  "data": { /* Response data */ },
  "requestId": "uuid-v4"
}
```

Error responses follow this format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human-readable error message"
  },
  "requestId": "uuid-v4"
}
```
