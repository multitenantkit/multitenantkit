# Username

The `username` field is the **human-friendly identifier** used to find and invite users across your application. Unlike `id` or `externalId` (which are internal identifiers), the username is what users actually know and share—typically an email, but it could be a phone number, handle, or any unique human-readable identifier.

## What is Username?

In MultiTenantKit, the `username` field serves as the **user-facing identifier** for finding and referencing other users. While `id` and `externalId` are technical identifiers managed by the system, the `username` is designed for end-users to interact with.

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;           // Internal UUID
  externalId: string;   // Auth provider's ID
  username: string;     // User-facing identifier (email, handle, etc.)
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Why Do We Need Username?

The key problem username solves is: **How do you identify a user who may or may not exist in your database yet?**

Consider the team invitation scenario:
- **UserA** exists in your database and is part of TeamX
- **UserB** doesn't exist yet—they haven't signed up

If you want to invite UserB to your team, you can't use their `id` or `externalId` because they don't have one yet. The `username` provides a **stable, human-known identifier** that works regardless of whether the user exists in your system.

### Identifying Users: Existing vs. New

When inviting someone to a team:

- **Existing user** (already in database): Can be identified by `id`, `externalId`, or `username`
- **New user** (not in database): Can only be identified by `username`

The username is the **common identifier** that works in both cases, without needing to know if the user exists in your database.

```typescript
// Look up user by username (works whether they exist or not)
const user = await userRepository.findByUsername("colleague@example.com");

if (user) {
  // User exists → proceed with internal ID
  await addMemberToOrganization(user.id, organizationId);
} else {
  // User doesn't exist → send invitation using username
  await sendInvitation("colleague@example.com", organizationId);
}
```

## Common Username Types

Different applications use different username formats based on their use case:

| Use Case | Username Format | Example |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| **B2B SaaS** | Email address | `john@company.com` |
| **Consumer App** | Handle/username | `@johndoe` |
| **Mobile-first** | Phone number | `+1234567890` |
| **Enterprise** | Employee ID | `E12345` |
